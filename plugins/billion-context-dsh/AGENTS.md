# billion-context-dsh — Development Specification

> **This document is the highest-priority specification. All developers (including AI Agents) MUST comply.**

## 1. Project Overview

**billion-context-dsh** is Active Context Pruning (ACP) for the [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) — model-driven context management delivered as a `CompactionEngine` backend. It is a **port/derivation** of [billion-context-pi](https://github.com/ranxianglei/billion-context-pi) (by ranxianglei, MIT); the compression core [acp-kernel](https://github.com/ranxianglei/acp-kernel) is reused verbatim.

The model decides *when* and *what* to compress — not a hard limit. Automatic policy never summarizes by itself: it only nudges.

### Tech Stack

| Category | Technology |
|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript (strict, ESM, `.ts` import suffixes) |
| Build | tsup (bundles, **inlines acp-kernel**; `@deepseek-ai/*` stays external) |
| Test | Node.js built-in: `node --import tsx --test tests/*.test.ts tests/kernel-upstream/*.test.ts` |
| Runtime Deps | `acp-kernel` (inlined at build); peer: `@deepseek-ai/dsh-compaction`, `@deepseek-ai/cordis` |
| Host | DeepSeek Harness (composition row `name: 'billion-context-dsh'`) |

Design decisions (see docs/dsh-porting-verification.md for the full evidence):

1. **Durable surface model** — DSH has NO in-memory message rewrite hook (`llm/stream` is read-only, `deriveMessages` is a pure projection). All compression is a durable `surfaceOp: { op: 'replace' }`; originals stay in the append-only log (decompress/search rebuild from the log).
2. **Seq is the ref** — no `<acp>` tags; the nudge's range table carries surface seqs.
3. **No automatic summarization** — `compactIfNeeded` returns null; nudges are advisory, never imperative (default copy aligned with kernel/pi: efficiency note, not "suggestion, not a requirement"; the emergency tier alone says "compress now").
4. **Model-driven summaries** — the model writes the summary via `compress`; no second LLM summarization call.
5. **`acp-kernel` pinned to an exact version** (e.g. `"acp-kernel": "0.0.29"`, NEVER `^`). It is inlined by tsup; a caret range breaks reproducibility.
6. **Search trusts the kernel** — `search_context` feeds the rebuilt doc set straight to `searchBlocks` (hybrid) and surfaces the scores; the engine adds NO second-tier gate/threshold (an early BM25 no-match gate was removed after it killed 6/46 real queries — synonyms and stemmed matches that hybrid would have found). A low fuzzy-only score (≈0.3 ceiling on noise) is for the model to judge from the surfaced score, not for the engine to filter. Algorithm bugs belong in acp-kernel, never re-implemented here.
7. **Trust the kernel for EVERYTHING it owns — not just search** — every kernel-provided capability (compression, refs, token counting, status report, nudge copy, search) is used as-is, never re-implemented, worked around, or patched on our side. When the kernel misbehaves, the fix goes **upstream** (acp-kernel issue + PR), not into this repo. Our repo only owns what the kernel explicitly does NOT (see rule 9's "kernel owns the prompt/format, the engine owns the wiring", and the Pi↔DSH mapping table in docs/dsh-porting-analysis.md §3): DSH host integration (event shapes, session semantics), surface-seq id dialect (no `<acp>` tags), durability (log, ledger, region), and host-specific channel quirks (envelope wrap, reentrancy). A **temporary, labeled workaround** is allowed ONLY when an upstream fix cannot land immediately: it MUST carry an explicit `UPSTREAM:` comment naming the upstream issue/PR, be tracked in docs/dsh-porting-verification.md, and be REMOVED the moment the upstream fix is released (see rule 11). Adapter-layer work is not a workaround — it is our job. A kernel bug worked around silently is a violation.

## 3. Hard-won rules (from v0.1.1 long-session battle)

These are NOT style preferences — each cost a live-session bug:

1. **Token estimation MUST use `defaultCountTokens`** (CJK-aware: 1 char/token for CJK, 4 chars/token otherwise) — NEVER `estimateTokensFast` (flat 4 chars/token). This is the billion-context-pi algorithm.
2. **Nudge usage MUST prefer `sessionProjections.contextPressure.projectedTokens`** (matches UI context-occupancy display, includes fixed overhead) — NEVER `.totalTokens` (request+response pressure; observed 230% vs ~20% real). Falls back to `tokenMeter.measure(session).surfaceTokens`, then `defaultCountTokens` character heuristic. Displayed percentage is capped at 100.
3. **Nudge range table MUST be computed from the surface** (`buildCompressibleSeqRanges`), NOT from kernel `compressibleRanges` — `UPSTREAM:` the kernel ref map drifts after surface replacements in long sessions, hiding large tool results and producing `end < start` ranges (labeled workaround per rule 11 — tracked in docs/dsh-porting-verification.md, revisit on the next kernel bump and drop this once the drift is fixed upstream). Ranges are ordered **oldest-first** (stable across turns — the model can consume them front-to-back without re-ranking; matches the kernel's `oldest first` list and the host's compression rhythm) and each row carries a **kernel-parity tool/text share** (`[tool X% | text Y%]`, count-based `toolPct` via `isToolEvent` — tool-call + tool-result both count as tool) so the model can spot consumed tool-heavy spans without a drilldown.
4. **Range solving is shrink-then-expand** — `resolveSurfaceRange` shrinks edges inward to balanced cuts; if that collapses (a lone tool message), it EXPANDS outward to the smallest balanced tool-call/result pair. A model compressing a single "consumed tool output" is the norm, not the error.
5. **Test fixtures MUST mirror real DSH structures** — a real tool-result block is `{ type: 'tool-result', toolCallId, content: ContentBlock[] }` (nested), NOT `{ callId, output }`. `extractText` recurses into nested `content`. A wrong fixture silently passes while production breaks (this exact mismatch hid the seq-without-ref bug).
6. **Ledger is log-rebuilt** — `rebuildBlockLedger` reads `compaction/summary` events; a `shadowedTokenCount: 0` entry is BACKFILLED from the shadowed originals in the log (legacy blocks must still report real reclaimed tokens).
7. **Stale seqs are recovered, not errors** — a compress range whose edges were shadowed by an earlier compression (old nudge table / old compress result) is remapped to the still-live content of the requested span (`recoverStaleRange` in `resolveSurfaceRange`); a fully shadowed span throws `AlreadyCompressedRangeError`, which `handleCompress` reports as "already compressed" with the covering block ids. Block checkpoint nodes are NEVER folded on a stale reference — distillation (tier 2/3) stays an explicit act on a LIVE checkpoint seq. Invented/other-session seqs (not in the log) still fail with acp_status guidance. Prompt-only guidance proved insufficient: the engine must absorb the stale reference.
8. **Successful compress call/result pairs MUST be hidden (DEFERRED); orphan tool messages MUST be pruned before range solving (but never in-flight calls)** — the durable summary node is written mid-turn, before the current `compress` tool/result lands, so leaving that pair visible produces `assistant(tool_calls) → user(summary) → tool(result)`, which strict providers reject with HTTP 400. `session.append` is NOT reentrant: hiding synchronously inside the `session/event` listener throws "session append cannot reenter while another append is being published" on live sessions and the dispatcher silently swallows it, so the engine defers the hide to a microtask (`deferCompressPairHide`) that drains before the agent loop resumes. Only a node carrying EXACTLY the compress call is hidden — hiding a multi-call node would orphan its siblings' results (the visible pair is position-safe on the current harness anyway). Separately, orphan tool messages corrupt the pairing balance cache and fragment large ranges: `stripOrphanedSurfaceToolMessages` prunes orphan `tool/result`s, assistant nodes whose calls all lack results, AND "broken pairs" whose result is not adjacent to the call on the surface (a compaction summary a buggy older version inserted between them — auto-heals deadlocked legacy sessions), all via the durable `compaction/prune` protocol. The strip runs before every range solve: at `agent/pre-step` UNCONDITIONALLY (a low-pressure session must not 400 on a crash orphan), inside `buildCompressibleSeqRanges`, and at the top of `handleCompress`, which protects ALL in-flight calls of the step (`openToolCallIds`), not just its own call id, so a sibling tool in the same assistant message is never pruned before its result lands. Finally, one kernel-rejected range (e.g. messages fully absorbed into an earlier block's `effectiveMessageIds` → "Range contains no compressible messages") must not poison a batch: `handleCompress` fails only when nothing landed, otherwise it lands the successful blocks and reports the failures as advisory lines.
9. **The model tool `acp_status` MUST be rendered by kernel `buildStatusReport`** (upstream-aligned CONTEXT BREAKDOWN / COMPRESSED BLOCKS) — NEVER hand-roll the breakdown format in the engine. The engine only appends the kernel nudge decision line and the DSH `Surface:` seq anchor. Window semantics (`estimated context` / `context window` rows) stay OUT of the model tool — they are a human-side `/acp` concern. The `messages` fed to `buildStatusReport` MUST exclude checkpoint summary nodes (`source.plugin === 'compact'`), or the summary is double-counted (once as `block.summary` summaries, once as visible text). `decompress` accepts the kernel block ref (`bN`, what acp_status shows) via `blockIdOfKernelRef` — exact `/^b\d+$/` match first, compaction-id prefix fallback — so the displayed block rows are directly usable by the model. **Drilldown passes through verbatim**: `handleStatus` forwards `scope`/`view`/`tool`/`sort`/`limit` to `buildStatusReport` (all optional; no args = overview), and a drilldown request answers with the kernel report alone — no Nudge decision line (upstream mirror `if (args.scope) return base`) — while the `Surface:` anchor stays in every mode because it is the model's compressible-ref locator. **Drilldown rows are kernel refs (mN, dense log-order ids); compress ACCEPTS them** — `handleCompress` reverse-maps an mN boundary to the live surface seq via the CURRENT turn's `state.messageRefs.byRef` (CoreMessage.id = seq, or `seq#callId` → split on `#`; the ref map must come from `turn.state` after `processTurn`, never the persisted store state, because acp_status's turn is never persisted — a store-state lookup would dead-loop the model with false "unknown mN" errors). An unknown mN (never assigned on the current surface) fails with guidance; a valid mN whose span was already compressed reuses the recover-stale / already-compressed semantics (rule 7). The engine never rewrites kernel report text. **The model channel may wrap ANY tool's args under `{ arguments: {…} }`** (same double-nesting that birthed `unwrapCompressArgs`; live-verified `{"arguments":{"scope":"compressed"}}` silently rendered the overview) — `handleStatus` MUST peel the envelope (`unwrapEnvelope`, object or JSON-string forms) before passing options to `buildStatusReport`. acp_status is the ONLY all-optional tool, so the envelope passes schema validation and would drop params silently; decompress/search_context reject the envelope at the schema gate (required `blockId`/`query` missing) — a loud, correct failure, keep those properties required. This is the kernel-copy principle from the config.prompts work applied to acp_status: kernel owns the prompt/format, the engine owns the wiring (docs/acp-status-align-design.md).
10. **Tool identity lives in `message.source.callId` / the nested `tool-result` block — NEVER `message.toolName`** — a real DSH `tool/result` event carries no `toolName`/`toolCallId` at the message level (39/39 live events verified). The projection backfills `toolName`/`toolCallId` from an index of assistant tool-call ids (`buildToolCallIndex` → `call.id → call.name`), keyed by the SAME `toolCallIdOfResultEvent` extractor (`block.toolCallId ?? source.callId`) that `src/region.ts` uses for call/result pairing — one shared implementation in `src/messages.ts`, never a copy. Without the backfill every tool output lands in an empty-named category: `acp_status`'s `Top tools` renders ` (62%)` and the kernel Tip line reads `tool:""`, silently hiding the true tool from the model. Test fixtures MUST use the real shape (`source.callId` + nested `tool-result` block) — a faked `message.toolName` fixture passes while production breaks (rule 5). The index is a pre-scan, so a result preceding its call still resolves, and an event with no identity stays `''` (empty name, NOT `undefined` — the kernel's `toolName ?? "text"` would mislabel it as text).
11. **Kernel defects are fixed UPSTREAM, never patched locally** — when the kernel misbehaves (ref-map drift, wrong token counts, wrong search hits, layout bugs), the fix belongs in acp-kernel: file an upstream issue, land the PR there, then bump the pin here. A local workaround is the exception, allowed ONLY when an upstream fix cannot land immediately, and then ONLY as a labeled stopgap: an explicit `UPSTREAM:` comment (naming the upstream issue/PR), a tracking row in docs/dsh-porting-verification.md, and a removal gate — the workaround MUST be deleted once the upstream fix is released (design decision 7). Silent local patches are a violation even when they work: they fork the algorithm, drift from upstream fixes, and turn this repo into a second kernel. **Current labeled workarounds**: `buildCompressibleSeqRanges` (kernel ref-map drift after surface replacements — rule 3; revisit on the next kernel bump and drop it if the drift is fixed upstream).

## 4. Development standards

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck   # strict TS, --noEmit
npm test            # node --import tsx --test tests/*.test.ts tests/kernel-upstream/*.test.ts
npm run build       # tsup (inlines acp-kernel) + tsc --emitDeclarationOnly
```

- **No `as any`**, **No `@ts-ignore`**, No `require` in tests (ESM; use static imports).
- Add a regression test for every bug fix (see tests/ for the battle-report tests: CJK estimation, stale-range filtering, lone tool expansion, legacy backfill).
- Keep `@deepseek-ai/*` devDeps on the **0.1.0-rc.6 line** (aligned with `@deepseek-ai/dsh-compaction` peer). Do not mix rc lines.
- **Git worktrees MUST be created inside `worktrees/`** in the project root (e.g. `git worktree add worktrees/<branch> <branch>`). The `worktrees/` directory is gitignored and never pushed. Never create worktrees outside the project.
- **Docs must stay in sync with every PR** — before opening a PR, review the diff against the documentation: any behavior the change alters must match what the docs describe, and docs that state the old behavior must be updated in the same PR. A PR that changes behavior without touching docs is incomplete.
- **Feature work MUST document itself** — every feature (any behavior addition or change) must add an explanation of the new capability in the relevant docs: user-facing config/options in `README.md` / `README.en.md`, install-time composition options in `docs/INSTALL.md`, design decisions in `docs/*-design.md`, and the module map / hard-won rules in `AGENTS.md` itself. Precedent: the `config.prompts` feature shipped its README section, INSTALL note, config table row, and design doc in the same PR.

### Commit messages

The convention applies to the **squash-merge subject on main**, which IS the PR title (main is branch-protected; see §5). **Commits inside a PR are free-form** — only the final squash subject is constrained. Single-line subject, prefix by change kind (the description after the prefix is free-form, keep it informative):

- `(feat) <summary>` — feature work (e.g. `(feat) tier-2/3 block distillation — …`)
- `(fix) <summary>` — bug fixes
- `(refactor) <summary>` — internal restructuring without behavior change
- `(test) <summary>` — tests only
- `(chore) <summary>` — tooling / process (CI, deps, scripts)
- `docs: <summary>` — documentation only (README, docs/, AGENTS.md)
- `release vX.Y.Z` — the release commit, exactly as in §5 (unchanged)

The PR title is enforced by CI (`.github/workflows/pr-lint.yml` → `scripts/check-pr-title.mjs`), since a squash merge turns it into the main-branch commit (e.g. `(feat) guide multi-segment batch compress + regression test`). Contributor guidance lives in CONTRIBUTING.md. PR merges stay human-only (§5).

## 4b. acp-kernel upgrade policy (the kernel WILL move on)

`acp-kernel` is pinned **exactly** (e.g. `0.0.29`, never `^`) because tsup inlines it — a caret range makes the resolved version drift when the lockfile regenerates, breaking reproducible builds. But pinning is **not** freezing: upgrades are a controlled, manual process.

**When to check:** on any feature work, or monthly — `npm view acp-kernel version`.

**Upgrade SOP (each step gates the next):**

1. `npm view acp-kernel versions` — pick the target. Read its changelog / git diff for breaking changes.
2. Watch these hot spots (kernel changes here have bit us before):
   - `defaultCountTokens` / tokenizer behavior (CJK estimation, `createBpeTokenizer`) — tests/assert 100 CJK = 100 tokens
   - `CompressionState` shape (`messageRefs`, blocks) — `state.ts`, `region.ts` read it structurally
   - ref assignment / `compressibleRanges` — we self-compute the range table as a labeled `UPSTREAM:` workaround for kernel ref-map drift (rule 3 / rule 11); on every bump CHECK whether the drift is fixed upstream — if so, DROP the workaround and use kernel `compressibleRanges` again
   - `CoreMessage` / `NudgeDecision` types — `messages.ts`, `nudge.ts`
3. Bump the exact version in `package.json`, run `npm install` (refreshes lock), then `npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build`.
4. **The test suite is the safety net**: 152 tests cover the battle-hardened behaviors (CJK estimation, lone-tool expansion, surface range table, ledger backfill, ref-tag projection, orphan-tool pruning, broken-pair healing, deferred compress call/result hiding, in-flight call preservation, batch resilience, acp_status upstream alignment, dual-id bN decompress, tool-result toolName backfill, acp_status drilldown passthrough + mN/seq separation + checkpoint row exclusion + multi-call survival, compress accepts drilldown mN refs (mapped to live surface seqs; unknown mN fails with guidance), nudge range table tool/text share + oldest-first ordering, wrapped-`{ arguments }` envelope peel, searchBlocks hybrid retrieval: stemmed/CJK matching, shadowed-message hits, innermost tier-1 block back-link, `/acp status` nudge arbitration (read-only processTurn on a cloned state — `nudge: idle/ACTIVE — reason` + distance to the next nudge; never writes the store) + ledger listing + dual-id decompress; plus `tests/kernel-upstream/` — 36 vendored upstream acp-kernel search tests (searchBlocks/blockDocs/messageDocs role weighting, algorithm selection, CJK/fuzzy gates, async-misuse guard) migrated to the public API, see issue #30). Any kernel behavior change that breaks one of those turns red here — do NOT release on red.
5. Optionally enable new kernel features deliberately (e.g. `createBpeTokenizer()` behind a config flag) — never adopt silently.
6. Release per the workflow below (bump own version, publish, `gh release create`).

If a kernel major version breaks the seam contracts, treat it as a porting task: re-verify against docs/dsh-porting-verification.md before shipping.

## 5. Release workflow

Pre-flight (ALL must pass): `npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build`.

1. Bump version: `npm version <patch|minor|major> --no-git-tag-version` (bug fixes → patch).
2. Update the `vX.Y.Z` references in `README.md`, `README.en.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/index.md` (Beta notice + Release links).
3. `npm publish`.
4. Commit `release vX.Y.Z` (package.json + package-lock.json + docs), push.
5. `gh release create vX.Y.Z` with notes listing fixes + live verification data.
6. GitHub Pages rebuilds automatically (workflow `pages.yml`).

> PR merges are **human-only**. The Agent MUST NEVER merge any PR.
>
> **`main` is branch-protected**: direct pushes are blocked — every commit, including `release vX.Y.Z`, lands via a PR that passed the required checks (`ci`, `pr-title`). No reviewer approval is required (solo maintainer). See CONTRIBUTING.md.

## 6. Upstream & attribution

- Always credit upstream in README/docs: **billion-context-pi**, **acp-kernel**, **opencode-acp** (ranxianglei, MIT) and **DeepSeek Harness** (DeepSeek AI).
- Do not change kernel default behavior without an explicit reason — kernel defaults match billion-context-pi (nudge window 45%–75%, emergency 95%, `defaultCountTokens`), but the engine deliberately ships lower nudge thresholds (max 0.70, emergency 0.85) so the forced nudge fires before the host compaction-basic 80% line (see `src/index.ts` `DEFAULT_CONFIG` and `src/config.ts` NOTE).
- Keep the Beta notice prominent (project and host are both public beta; not for production).
